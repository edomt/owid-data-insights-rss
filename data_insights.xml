            is hard to imagine just how violent the past was.<br /><br />The chart shows that in the
            13th and 14th centuries, based on data from researcher Manuel Eisner, homicide rates
            across Western Europe were higher than 10 murders per 100,000 people in a year. In
            Italy, the rate was as high as 70 murders per 100,000 people.<br /><br />Since then,
            murder rates have fallen significantly across these countries. According to data from
            WHO’s Mortality Database, their homicide rate is now around 1 murder per 100,000 people
            — less than a tenth of what it used to be.<br /><br />Despite these improvements,
            homicides remain a common <a

            death</a> globally and are even a <a

                cause</a> in some countries. But significant and lasting reductions in violence
            between people are possible. </a>
